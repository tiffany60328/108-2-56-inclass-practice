## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
install.packages("purrr")
library(purrr)
```

```{r}
library(jsonlite)
fromJSON("https://www.dropbox.com/s/6252gbdnv9owljm/dance.json?dl=1", simplifyDataFrame = F) -> dance
```

```{r}
# 前三筆演出的名稱
dance[[1]]$title
dance[[2]]$title
dance[[3]]$title 
```

```{r}
library(purrr)
map(dance,~.x$title) -> dance_title
```
```{r}
dance[[1]]$showInfo
length(dance[[1]]$showInfo)

dance[[2]]$showInfo
length(dance[[1]]$showInfo)
```
```{r}
length(dance[[1]]$showInfo)
length(dance[[2]]$showInfo)
# :
length(dance[[34]]$showInfo)
```

```{r}
map(dance,~length(.x$showInfo)) -> dance_showInfoLength
```
